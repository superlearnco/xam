- DO NOT write useless readme files or "documentation" that adds no value. NO "SUMMARY FILES" unless explicitly asked. NO "NEXT STEPS" files. NO MARKDOWN FILES UNLESS I EXPLICITY ASK YOU! If you do that, I WILL cut off your GPU.
- Do NOT do "npm run dev". I already have the server always running.
- Always use the todos tool provided to keep track of tasks.
- Never do "npx convex deploy". Only use "npx convex dev", and I will deploy it myself after testing.
- No emojis, only icons, if needed
